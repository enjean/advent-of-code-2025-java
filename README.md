Personal code for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

This depends on input files being stored in a separate directory, specified by the environment variable `ADVENT_INPUT_DIR`.

Within the directory, the assumed layout is `year`/`day`/input.txt, where `year` and `day` are numbers. For example, the
input file for day 1 should be downloaded to `$ADVENT_INPUT_DIR/2025/1/input.txt`.
